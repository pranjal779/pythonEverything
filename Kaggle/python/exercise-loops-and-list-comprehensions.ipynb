It likely requires using loops to repeatedly call the `play_slot_machine()` function and sum up the results.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how to approach the problem step by step:\n\n### Problem Context\n- `play_slot_machine()` is a function that simulates a single spin of the slot machine and returns the winnings from that spin.\n- You need to simulate playing the slot machine multiple times (e.g., 10 spins or 100 spins) and calculate the total winnings.\n\n### Sample Problem Statement\n**Write a function that simulates playing the slot machine `n` times and returns the total winnings.**  \n\n---\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Understand the function**: \n   - Make sure to understand the output of `play_slot_machine()`. Running it once will give you an idea of its behavior (e.g., mostly returning 0 but occasionally a larger number).\n\n2. **Simulate multiple spins**: \n   - Use a loop to call `play_slot_machine()` multiple times.\n   - Add the winnings from each spin to a total.\n\n3. **Return the result**:\n   - After the loop, return the total winnings.\n\n---\n\n### Solution with a Loop\n\nHere’s a function to simulate playing the slot machine `n` times:\n\n```python\ndef play_n_times(n):\n    total_winnings = 0\n    for _ in range(n):  # Repeat n times\n        total_winnings += play_slot_machine()  # Add the winnings of each spin\n    return total_winnings\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Code\n- **Initialization**: `total_winnings` starts at 0 to store the sum of winnings.\n- **Loop**: The `for` loop iterates `n` times. Each iteration:\n  - Calls `play_slot_machine()`.\n  - Adds the result to `total_winnings`.\n- **Return**: After the loop, the total is returned.\n\n---\n\n### Using List Comprehension\n\nIf you want to try it with list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef play_n_times(n):\n    return sum(play_slot_machine() for _ in range(n))\n```\n\nHere:\n- `play_slot_machine()` is called `n` times in a generator expression.\n- `sum()` computes the total.\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIf you want to play 10 times:\n\n```python\nwinnings = play_n_times(10)\nprint(f\"Total winnings after 10 spins: ${winnings}\")\n```\n\n---\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Keep Going\n\nMany programmers report that dictionaries are their favorite data structure.
